# Project Setup and Middleware Design Best Practices\n\n- **Modular Structure**: Use /project-root/chats/middleware/ for custom middleware files.\n- **Middleware**: Keep each custom middleware in a separate Python file under chats/middleware/ for clarity.\n- **Documentation**: Use this Markdown file for maintainability.\n- **Logging**: Ensure requests.log exists and is used by RequestLoggingMiddleware.
