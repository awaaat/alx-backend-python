    Middleware to log requests made to /api/chats/ endpoints with user context.

    - Timestamp of request
    - Authenticated user (from JWT)
    - HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.)
    - Request path
    - Response status code
    - Sanitized request payload (to protect sensitive data)

    It focuses on monitoring chat-related API endpoints like
    /api/chats/users/ and /api/chats/conversations/.
